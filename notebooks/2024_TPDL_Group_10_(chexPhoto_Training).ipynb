It is crucial for diagnosing various respiratory and heart-related conditions. However, with the increased demand for radiological reports within shorter timeframes to detect and treat illnesses, there have been insufficient radiologists available to perform such tasks at scale. Therefore, automated chest radiograph interpretation could provide substantial benefits supporting large-scale screening and population health initiatives. Deep-learning algorithms can be used to bridge this gap. They have been used for image classification, anomaly detection, organ segmentation, and disease progression prediction.\n\n*In this project, we aim to train a deep neural network to perform multi-label image classification on a wide array of chest radiograph images that exhibit various pathologies.*<br><br>\n\n---\n\n\n","block_group":"6dee2305d0a64fc0b7796c420b390905"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vca9P0PG41JP","cell_id":"5061937273004b9e8b4f895d7115cfe2","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"##
